    <!-- About the source of the albums -->
    <p class = "aboutAlbums">
        These albums are all currently owned by my family. With a collection of over 400 individual classic albums, ranging from
        The Beatles, to George Carlin specials, all the way to old blues and jazz 78's dating back to pre-WW2, this
        is a compilation of albums and records with a size unlike many others. After spending weeks sifting through each of these albums 
        individually, an excel sheet was created documenting the albums name, the creator, and the year of release. Using this information,
        I created this website as a way to display some of the more popular and well known albums in our collection as well as their 
        common price.
